## structured description of its components and functionalities:

### Base Rotation (1st DOF):
Stepper motor at the bottom
Enables 360-degree rotation for comprehensive coverage

### Shoulder Joint (2nd DOF):
Servo motor connected above the base
Provides 180-degree vertical movement (up and down)

### Elbow Joint (3rd DOF):
Revolute joint
Allows 180-degree vertical articulation

### Wrist Rotation (4th DOF):
Another servo motor
Facilitates 180-degree side-to-side movement

### End Effector Control (5th DOF):
Revolute joint at the arm's extremity
Controls the gripper with 180-degree side-to-side motion

This configuration offers a wide range of motion and versatility, allowing the arm to reach various positions and orientations in its workspace. The combination of stepper and servo motors with revolute joints provides both precision and flexibility in movement, making it suitable for diverse robotic applications.
